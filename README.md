#Plan
* Create a Promodoro timer
* ask for timings( How long will you work / resting )
* save data into file
* save data into database like structure 
* Create statistics based on working hours
    * how much time do you spend on xyz
    * when are you doing xyz

#Lets RPG a bit 
* create multiple files and folders.(builded)
* user ist able to save his pomotime and use it as exp.
* a character is created ( in a new folder/file structure )
* there must be a reason to stop the clock and take a break
Example:
    * level up you char when working (timer goes up)
    * char needs to sleep/eat/fight/search/brew ...
        * this will only happen when the user is taking a break (timer goes down)
